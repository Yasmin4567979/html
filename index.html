<h1>6 Ideas for Stunning City Photography (+ Examples)</h1>
<img src="./images/blog photo no 1.png" alt="ideas for gorgeous city photography"/>
<p>Towns and cities may be noisy, busy, stressful,and congested – yet they provide amazing opportunities
   for photos. You can capture gorgeous skyline shots, amazing snaps featuring architectural landmarks, 
   images of passersby dwarfed by giant skyscrapers, and so much more.</p>

<p>However, if you’re new to the city or you’re an urban photo veteran in a creative rut, you might be looking for a 
   few helpful ideas; that’s where this article comes into play.</P>

<P>Below, I share six easy ideas for city photography.Whether you live in a bustling metropolis or a sleepy seaside 
   town, you’re bound to find something on this list.So without further ado, let’s dive right in, starting 
   with:</p>

<h2>1. City skyscrapers</h2>

<p>While not every city offers skyscrapers, if you’re lucky enough to live in a busy area, you’re bound to
   have access to a tall building or two – and these can make for amazing city photo subjects</p>

<p>You have all sorts of options. For instance, you  can travel to the base of a skyscraper and shoot
   upward. If the city features a handful of skyscrapers across a small area, try getting
   into position beneath several of the buildings,then shoot a beautiful multi-skyscraper composition.
   (Even better: Wait until the weather is foggy, then capture your favorite skyscrapers receding into the
   clouds.)</p>

<h2>2. The nocturnal cityscape</h2>

<p>Cities look amazing at sunrise, sunset, and even during the day – but have you considered shooting
   your favorite cityscape locations at night?</p>

<p>Thanks to the bright lights of the city skyline, it’s possible to create all sorts of gorgeous images
   after dark, including stunning long-exposure shots that combine artificial lighting with dark alleys,
   eerie parks, and even moving water.</p>
        
<p>You can shoot from smack-dab in the middle of the city or from afar; the key is to bring a tripod and
   a remote release so you can use lengthy shutter speeds without issue. It can also help to bracket your 
   images and blend the files together using HDR techniques during post-processing.</p>

<p>A great time to shoot nocturnal cityscapes is just after dark. The light from the sky won’t have completely
   faded, giving you a bit more illumination (and color) to work with, and the building lights will generally 
   provide a gorgeous golden glow.</p>

<h2>3. City reflections</h2> 
    
<p>If you live in a touristy city, certain buildings and city landmarks may feel so over-photographed that you’re 
   reluctant to point your camera in their direction.</p>

<p>One way to capture more original images of these locations is to change up your angle or perspective – in particular, 
   I recommend finding some water, then shooting with a wide-angle lens so as to include the buildings, any interesting 
   landmarks, and their reflections.</p>
        
<p>Not all cities sit along bays, lakes, or rivers, of course, but that’s no reason to give up on reflection shots. You
       can use puddles or fountains to capture interesting water reflections, or you can use shiny glass or metal to get the 
   result you’re looking for.</p>

<h2>4. Street scenes at night</h2>

<p>One of my city photography ideas (suggested above) is to photograph cityscapes at night, but I’d also encourage you to
   capture street scenes after dark – in other words, look for opportunities to combine buildings and people for amazing results.</p>

<p>You can take a few approaches here. One option is to use a tripod and tackle the street scenes like a cityscape shooter. 
   Set up a composition, wait for the right person to walk through, and when the moment is right, press that shutter button.
   (You’ll want to keep an eye on your shutter speed, but even if the person is slightly blurry, that’s okay; it’s really more
   about the feeling of the entire scene.)</p>

<h2>5. The city from above</h2>
<p>Aerial images give viewers a completely new perspective, even if the shots depict buildings and city landmarks they’ve seen
   hundreds or even thousands of times.
</p>

<p>That’s why, if you have the opportunity, I really encourage you to grab a wide-angle lens, get up high, and see what you can create.</p>

<h2>6. The city and its environment</h2>

<p>Most city photographers capture images that focus on the buildings and their features, but if you’re after truly unique images, 
   why not find a distant vantage point and see if you can contextualize the city?</p>

<p>By including the surrounding forests, plains, lakes, or suburbs, you can give viewers a sense of the city and its environment.
   You generally will need to find a vantage point of some sort – here, a drone can be helpful, though you can also shoot from a distant hill or structure.</p>

<p>A wide-angle lens generally gives great results, though I’d encourage you to work with a variety of focal lengths to achieve 
   different effects!Most city photographers capture images that focus on the buildings and their features, but if you’re after 
   truly unique images, why not find a distant vantage point and see if you can contextualize the city?</p>
